# Animal Detection with TensorFlow on COCO Dataset for ESP32 Camera
This project trains a machine learning model using TensorFlow on the COCO dataset to recognize various animals, then optimizes the model for deployment on an ESP32 camera. The goal is to enable real-time animal detection on a low-power, embedded device like the ESP32, making it efficient and accessible.

# Features
- Train a Model with TensorFlow and COCO Dataset
- Model Optimization for ESP32
- Real-Time Detection on ESP32

# Prerequisties
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- ESP SDK (ESP32 Development)
- TFLite Micro (Deploying Tensorflow models)

# Datasets
This project uses the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. Specifically, we focus on the animal categories available in the dataset. You can download the dataset from https://cocodataset.org/#home , which contains a wide range of labeled images for model training.
